        <h1>The Most User-Friendly Document Management System </h1>
        <p>
          Keeping your paperless office documents only on your computer or local
          server poses the risks of hard drive failure, fire, flood or burglary.
          And what if you want to access one of those important files away from
          the office? Meet Folderit. The ultimate online document management
          system for any organization, the most user-friendly DMS in the world!
          Amazingly easy to use, highly secure
        </p>

            <h1>Approval Workflow & Automated Retention</h1>
            <p>
              Does an invoice, vacation application or another document need to
              be approved by one or several people before the next step? Not a
              problem! Invite people to approve and add their comments. In fixed
              order or all at once. It's never been easier to get and track
              approvals! Learn more about Approval Workflow! You can also set an
              optional retention period for any of the folders and files -- in
              days, weeks, months or years!
            </p>

            <h1>Custom Metadata & File Linking</h1>
            <p>
              Add tags, notes, date and due date to help organise your
              documents. You can easily add your own metadata fields of
              different types like lists, checkboxes and much more! You can also
              link files to create relations between documents in different
              folder structures. Metadata templates can be defined on
              folder-level too.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h1>Import Documents Over E-mail</h1>
            <p>
              Every folder has a dedicated e-mail address. Just send/forward an
              e-mail to that address and the attached file will end up in chosen
              folder with sender, subject and content info intact. It couldn't
              be any simpler, and it's perfect to store documents on the go or
              for sending them into your DMS from a scanner.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h1>Local Backup Too</h1>
            <p>
              Your documents are stored in a secure cloud and are perfectly
              safe, yet if you wish, you can easily download the whole account
              or individual files/folders to your hard-drive as often as you
              like for your local backup. Or use our Sync App for Windows
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h1>Safe & Secure</h1>
            <p>
              All your data is triple backed up and bank-level encrypted in the
              Folderit cloud document management system where it's safely stored
              and is transferred via secure SSL layer. You can also customize
              password policy (including 2FA) for your team members, so they can
              only choose extra long passwords and need to change their password
              as often as you wish.
            </p>

            <div>
             <h1>File Versions</h1>
             <p>You can upload a new version of a document and preserve the existing metadata and all earlier versions of the file -- which are always easily recoverable with just one click! A document check-in/check-out feature allows you to lock a document for others while you are editing it on your computer. And each version of a document can be independently approved.</p>
